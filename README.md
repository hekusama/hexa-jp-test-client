# Features
### Endless Japanese geography quiz
- This is the ultimate Japanese geography quiz with every prefecture, city, town and (almost) all stations! See [Included Railways](railwaysIncluded.md)
- Saves automatically (DO NOT tamper with the save file. It might behave weirdly if you edit the save.)
- Checkboxes are absolutely useless right now. They do absolutely nothing except completely break your progress limit.
- There's a reset button if you want to reset your save. (or just delete the old `geo_save.txt`)
### Nothing else! (for now)
# How to use
- Download the latest release from release sidebar.
- Unzip the zip file. (using 7zip or native extractor)

# PSA:
## PLEASE DO NOT RANDOMLY RUN FILES YOU RANDOMLY DOWNLOAD OFF THE INTERNET!!!
Always check for viruses using virustotal.com
Drag/drop exes you want to run. If it gets more than 2-3 yellow detections or 1 single red detection, DON'T RUN IT.
Only run detected files if you trust the source.
Of course, it could be a false positive.
Unless you know what you're doing, please run red-detected files AT YOUR OWN RISK
